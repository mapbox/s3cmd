# s3cmd

This is a Mapbox-maintained fork of https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd. We are using this because:
- we are pinned to [an older version of s3cmd](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd/commit/2dff2c09df092bed9c07c139e683d421592bd97e) 
- we need to add [support for ECS Task Roles](https://github.com/mapbox/s3cmd/pull/1)

Running the `master` branch of this repo does those two things.
